Prawn Cocktail
--------------

Ingredients
•	400g cooked atlantic shell-on prawn
•	4 Little Gem lettuces, washed and trimmed
•	5 heaped tbsp mayonnaise
•	5 tbsp tomato chutney
•	2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
•	2 tsp creamed horseradish
•	tiny splash Tabasco sauce
•	squeeze lemon juice
•	paprika for dusting
•	4 tsp snipped chive

Method
1)	Peel all but 4 of the prawns (reserve these for the tops). Break the lettuces into individual leaves, then divide the leaves evenly between 4 small glass bowls.
2)	Sprinkle the prawns over the lettuce and season with black pepper.
3)	Mix the mayonnaise, tomato chutney, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish and Tabasco together. Season to taste with lemon juice and salt and pepper, then spoon sparingly over the prawns. Dust the top with a little paprika and sprinkle with chives. Top with the remaining prawns and serve immediately. Delicious with brown bread.


Bruschetta
----------

Ingredients
•	2 handfuls nice mixed ripe tomatoes
•	1 small bunch fresh basil , leaves picked
•	sea salt
•	freshly ground black pepper
•	olive oil
•	good-quality white wine or herb vinegar
Method
1) The bread is best sliced 1cm thick and toasted on a barbecue, but it can also be done in a griddle pan for ease at home. After that it should be lightly rubbed a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic, then drizzled with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper. The toppings can be as humble or as luxurious as you like, from chopped herbs or a squashed tomato with basil, to marinated vegetables or beautiful cheeses, to lovely flaked crabmeat. The only rule is that whatever goes on top of a bruschetta should be nice and fresh and cooked with care.
2) Make sure your tomatoes are really ripe when making this topping. Give them a wash, remove their cores and carefully squeeze out the seeds. Place in a bowl, tear in the basil, season with salt and pepper, then toss with a good glug of olive oil and a good swig of vinegar to balance the flavours to your taste. You can serve the tomatoes either chunky or finely chopped, or you can scrunch them between your fingers before putting them on your basic bruschette – really tasty.


Mushroom Soup

•	600 g mixed mushrooms
•	1 onion
•	2 sticks of celery

3)	Heat a splash of olive oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat, add the onion, celery, garlic, parsley stalks, thyme leaves and mushrooms, pop the lid on and cook gently until softened.
4)	Spoon out 4 tablespoons of mushrooms, and keep for later.
5)	Pour the stock into the pan and bring to the boil over a medium heat, turn the heat down to low and simmer for 15 minutes.

Main courses
------------


Pizza Margherita
---------------

Ingredients:
For the base
300g strong bread flour
1 tsp instant yeast
 (from a sachet or a tub)
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil
, plus extra for drizzling
For the tomato sauce
100ml passata
handful fresh basil
 or 1 tsp dried
1 garlic clove, crushed
For the topping
125g ball mozzarella, sliced
handful grated or shaved parmesan
 (or vegetarian alternative)
handful cherry tomatoes, halved
To finish
handful basil
 leaves (optional)

Method:

Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
Roll out the dough: If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
Top and bake: Heat oven to 240C/fan 220C /gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.

Lemony courgette linguine
-------------------------

Ingredients
150 g dried linguine
2 mixed-colour courgettes
½ a bunch of fresh mint (15g)
30 g Parmesan cheese
1 lemon

Method
Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water.
Meanwhile, slice the courgettes lengthways, then again into long matchsticks with good knife skills or using the julienne cutter on a mandolin (use the guard!).
Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then add the courgettes. Cook for 4 minutes, tossing regularly, while you finely slice the mint leaves, then stir them into the pan.

Toss the drained pasta into the courgette pan with a splash of reserved cooking water. Finely grate in most of the Parmesan and a little lemon zest, squeeze in all the juice, toss well, then taste and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Dish up, finely grate over the remaining Parmesan and drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil before tucking in.


Ricotta & parmesan ravioli
--------------------------

Ingredients
½ x royal pasta dough
70 g Parmesan cheese , plus extra to serve
100 g ricotta cheese
6 medium free-range eggs
100 g unsalted butter
1 lemon
100 g frisée
extra virgin olive oil
6 slices higher-welfare prosciutto

Method
First, make your royal pasta dough, leaving it to rest for 30 minutes while you make the filling.
Finely grate 50g of Parmesan and beat with the ricotta, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Spoon into a piping bag and place in the fridge while you roll out your dough. Follow the rolling-out instructions, taking the pasta to 1mm thickness.
Lay the sheets on a clean surface, then carefully pipe a ring of ricotta about 5cm wide, starting 2.5cm away from the edge of the pasta.
Separate an egg and carefully drop the yolk into the middle of the ricotta circle – it should fit snugly. Start your next ring of ricotta 5cm away from where your first one ends, then repeat 4 times more.
Brush the exposed pasta with water and carefully lay the second sheet of pasta over the top.
Starting at one end, gently press the pasta around the outside of the filling, pushing out the air and sealing the edges. Using a 10cm round cutter, cut out a circle-shaped ravioli with the egg right in the middle.
Check the edges are sealed – use a little more water to help, if needed. Place the ravioli on a large tray dusted with semolina, making sure they don’t touch and continue with the rest.
Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then reduce the heat to a rolling simmer. Carefully lower in the ravioli, two or three at a time, and cook for 4 minutes, or until they float.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. As soon as it foams, finely grate in the lemon zest and add a squeeze of juice plus a pinch of pepper.
Remove the pasta with a slotted spoon straight into the butter sauce, adding a splash of pasta water and grating in the remaining Parmesan. Cook the next batch of ravioli, then add to the sauce.
Dress the frisée with half the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of oil, tear in the prosciutto, then season with pepper and mix together.
Divide the ravioli between your plates, arrange the frisée salad around it, then serve with a good grating of Parmesan.


Fettucino Al Fredo
------------------

• To make the sauce, heat the olive oil in a large frying pan. Add the shallots and mushrooms, then fry for about 10 mins until golden and caramelised. Pour in the vinegar, then simmer until almost evaporated. Add the red wine, then simmer until almost evaporated. Add the beef stock, bring to the boil, then reduce by two-thirds. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve, then keep warm until ready to serve. Can be made the day before and reheated.
• Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Season the beef generously with salt and pepper. Heat the sunflower oil in a large ovenproof frying pan on a high heat. Add the beef, then sear for 10 mins, turning, until browned all over. Transfer to the oven, then roast for approximately 20 mins, turning after 10 mins. This will give you beef that is medium rare; for medium, roast for an extra 5 mins. Allow the beef to rest on a rack, loosely covered in foil, for 10 mins, then slice into 6 thick slices. Add all juices from the beef to the sauce, then gently heat the sauce up and whisk in the butter.


Pizza Norma
-----------

• Sliced Egg pla nts
• Ricotta salata

Recipe:

Preparation

Before baking you must prepare eggplant. To remove the bitter taste of this vegetable, we'll have to cut it into cubes and soak it in salted water for at least one hour. This operation is very important, it is unthinkable to prepare this pizza using raw or grilled eggplant.

After about an hour, drain well eggplant to separate them from the water and fry the cubes in extra virgin olive oil to give a perfect browning.


Leavening

Let your pizzas rise well the dough always prepared well in advance. If it is possible, prepare it the day before and let it ripen to perfection in the fridge.

After the rising phase, proceed with the drafting of the balls.
Roll the balls to form discs of dough by the diameter of 30 centimeters, add the tomato, a generous layer of mozzarella, eggplant prepared previously fried diced, abundant grated ricotta, salt and pepper and bake in your oven preheated to 300 degrees for a few minutes, until the edge of your pizzas will prove to be golden at the right point.

Baked your pizzas and add a few leaves of fresh basil that give the characteristic aroma and flavor to this delicious pizza.

• 8 cups vegetable broth
• 2 cups arborio rice
