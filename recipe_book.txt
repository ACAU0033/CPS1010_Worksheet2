Bruschetta
Ingredients
•	2 handfuls nice mixed ripe tomatoes
•	1 small bunch fresh basil , leaves picked
•	sea salt
•	freshly ground black pepper
•	olive oil
•	good-quality white wine or herb vinegar
Method
1) The bread is best sliced 1cm thick and toasted on a barbecue, but it can also be done in a griddle pan for ease at home. After that it should be lightly rubbed a couple of times with a cut clove of garlic, then drizzled with some good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper. The toppings can be as humble or as luxurious as you like, from chopped herbs or a squashed tomato with basil, to marinated vegetables or beautiful cheeses, to lovely flaked crabmeat. The only rule is that whatever goes on top of a bruschetta should be nice and fresh and cooked with care.
2) Make sure your tomatoes are really ripe when making this topping. Give them a wash, remove their cores and carefully squeeze out the seeds. Place in a bowl, tear in the basil, season with salt and pepper, then toss with a good glug of olive oil and a good swig of vinegar to balance the flavours to your taste. You can serve the tomatoes either chunky or finely chopped, or you can scrunch them between your fingers before putting them on your basic bruschette – really tasty.

Preparation

Before baking must prepare eggplant, to remove the characteristic bitter taste of this vegetable, we'll have to cut it into cubes and soak in salted water for at least one hour. This operation is very important, it is unthinkable to prepare this pizza just using raw or grilled eggplant.

After about an hour, drain well eggplant to separate them from the water and fry the cubes in extra virgin olive oil to give a perfect browning.
Dough

For the pizza dough, as usual I invite you to read our post “pizza dough” which explains step by step procedures to be adopted to achieve a perfect dough.

Leavening

Let it rise well your pizzas, always the dough prepared well in advance, if there is possible, prepare it the day before and let it ripen to perfection in the fridge. Any recommendations for a perfect leavening are enclosed in our post available by clicking this link: “digest the pizza“.

After the rising phase, proceed with the drafting of the balls. If you are not an expert pizza makers, I suggest you take a look at our article about the detail drafting balls of pizza.
Roll the balls to form discs of dough by the diameter of 30 centimeters, add the tomato, a generous layer of mozzarella, eggplant prepared previously fried diced, abundant grated ricotta, salt and pepper and bake in your oven preheated to 300 degrees for a few minutes, until the edge of your pizzas will prove to be golden at the right point.

Baked your pizzas and add a few leaves of fresh basil that give the characteristic aroma and flavor to this delicious pizza.
