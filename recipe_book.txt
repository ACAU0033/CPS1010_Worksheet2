Pizza Margherita
---------------

Ingredients:
For the base
300g strong bread flour
1 tsp instant yeast
 (from a sachet or a tub)
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil
, plus extra for drizzling
For the tomato sauce
100ml passata
handful fresh basil
 or 1 tsp dried
1 garlic clove, crushed
For the topping
125g ball mozzarella, sliced
handful grated or shaved parmesan
 (or vegetarian alternative)
handful cherry tomatoes, halved
To finish
handful basil
 leaves (optional)

Method:

Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.
Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
Roll out the dough: If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
Top and bake: Heat oven to 240C/fan 220C /gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.

Lemony courgette linguine
-------------------------

Ingredients
150 g dried linguine
2 mixed-colour courgettes
½ a bunch of fresh mint (15g)
30 g Parmesan cheese
1 lemon

Method
Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according to the packet instructions, then drain, reserving a mugful of cooking water.
Meanwhile, slice the courgettes lengthways, then again into long matchsticks with good knife skills or using the julienne cutter on a mandolin (use the guard!).
Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then add the courgettes. Cook for 4 minutes, tossing regularly, while you finely slice the mint leaves, then stir them into the pan.

Toss the drained pasta into the courgette pan with a splash of reserved cooking water. Finely grate in most of the Parmesan and a little lemon zest, squeeze in all the juice, toss well, then taste and season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper. Dish up, finely grate over the remaining Parmesan and drizzle with 1 teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil before tucking in.


Ricotta & parmesan ravioli
--------------------------

Ingredients
½ x royal pasta dough
70 g Parmesan cheese , plus extra to serve
100 g ricotta cheese
6 medium free-range eggs
100 g unsalted butter
1 lemon
100 g frisée
extra virgin olive oil
6 slices higher-welfare prosciutto

Method
First, make your royal pasta dough, leaving it to rest for 30 minutes while you make the filling.
Finely grate 50g of Parmesan and beat with the ricotta, then season with sea salt and black pepper. Spoon into a piping bag and place in the fridge while you roll out your dough. Follow the rolling-out instructions, taking the pasta to 1mm thickness.
Lay the sheets on a clean surface, then carefully pipe a ring of ricotta about 5cm wide, starting 2.5cm away from the edge of the pasta.
Separate an egg and carefully drop the yolk into the middle of the ricotta circle – it should fit snugly. Start your next ring of ricotta 5cm away from where your first one ends, then repeat 4 times more.
Brush the exposed pasta with water and carefully lay the second sheet of pasta over the top.
Starting at one end, gently press the pasta around the outside of the filling, pushing out the air and sealing the edges. Using a 10cm round cutter, cut out a circle-shaped ravioli with the egg right in the middle.
Check the edges are sealed – use a little more water to help, if needed. Place the ravioli on a large tray dusted with semolina, making sure they don’t touch and continue with the rest.
Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, then reduce the heat to a rolling simmer. Carefully lower in the ravioli, two or three at a time, and cook for 4 minutes, or until they float.
Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. As soon as it foams, finely grate in the lemon zest and add a squeeze of juice plus a pinch of pepper.
Remove the pasta with a slotted spoon straight into the butter sauce, adding a splash of pasta water and grating in the remaining Parmesan. Cook the next batch of ravioli, then add to the sauce.
Dress the frisée with half the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of oil, tear in the prosciutto, then season with pepper and mix together.
Divide the ravioli between your plates, arrange the frisée salad around it, then serve with a good grating of Parmesan.
