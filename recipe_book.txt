Before baking must prepare eggplant, to remove the characteristic bitter taste of this vegetable, we'll have to cut it into cubes and soak in salted water for at least one hour. This operation is very important, it is unthinkable to prepare this pizza just using raw or grilled eggplant.

After about an hour, drain well eggplant to separate them from the water and fry the cubes in extra virgin olive oil to give a perfect browning.
Dough

For the pizza dough, as usual I invite you to read our post “pizza dough” which explains step by step procedures to be adopted to achieve a perfect dough.

Leavening

Let it rise well your pizzas, always the dough prepared well in advance, if there is possible, prepare it the day before and let it ripen to perfection in the fridge. Any recommendations for a perfect leavening are enclosed in our post available by clicking this link: “digest the pizza“.

After the rising phase, proceed with the drafting of the balls. If you are not an expert pizza makers, I suggest you take a look at our article about the detail drafting balls of pizza.
Roll the balls to form discs of dough by the diameter of 30 centimeters, add the tomato, a generous layer of mozzarella, eggplant prepared previously fried diced, abundant grated ricotta, salt and pepper and bake in your oven preheated to 300 degrees for a few minutes, until the edge of your pizzas will prove to be golden at the right point.

Baked your pizzas and add a few leaves of fresh basil that give the characteristic aroma and flavor to this delicious pizza.
