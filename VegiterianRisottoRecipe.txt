Vegiterian Risotto

•	3 tablespoons olive oil
•	8 cups vegetable broth
•	2 cups arborio rice
•	dash salt (to taste)
•	dash pepper (to taste)
•	2/3 cup parmesan (freshly grated)

Recipe: 

In a large skillet, heat the olive oil and add the arborio rice. Stirring constantly, allow the rice to cook for 3 to 4 minutes.
Add about a half cup of the vegetable broth to the rice, stirring frequently.
When most of the liquid has absorbed, add another half cup of broth. Continue adding broth, a bit at a time, until the rice is done cooking, about 20 minutes.
Remove from heat and stir in the parmesan until it has thoroughly melted.
Add salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle with additional cheese if desired.
